Embarking on a journey into the heart of cybersecurity, participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges offerd me an opportunity like no other.
As a student venturing into this electrifying realm, you step into a world where coding prowess, puzzle-solving finesse, and an insatiable curiosity are my greatest assets.
Beyond the classroom, CTF challenges beckon, invited me to decipher intricate riddles, exploit vulnerabilities, and pit my wits against some of the most perplexing digital enigmas.
am thankful to express my gratitude to the team members in Bi0s

  3.The circuit contained 1 arduino nano,Potentiometer,connecting wires.
  4.Assembled the circuit in a breadboard.
  5.Observed the serial monitor along  adjusting the potentiometer.
  6.At a particular value of resistance the flag appeared on the serial monitor.
-->micropython_flag
  1.Learned about ESP8266 module from internet.
  2.Done nessesary options in arduino idle.
  3.Adjusted correct baund rate in serial monitor.
  4.Due to prior Knowledge in python helped me to capture the python flag.
-->Esp-ionage
  1.Connected the module with PC and opened arduino idle and observed in serialmonitor for Hints.
  2.After that i connected the PC with it via wifi
  3.Opened the Browser and searched for the IP address of the module.
  4.From the  HTML page i got  the encrypted flag.
  5.I decrypted the encrypted flag using online cipher decrypting tool.
-->u_4rt
  1.Searched for how to use logic analyser in signal processing and learned about the signal processing software Saleae.
  2.Learned the use of tx and rx connection ports in arduino
  3.As per the Hint mentioned i connected the tx with CH2 and rx with CH3 and connected the ground common.
  4.Specified the input pin connections in saleae software and processed the signal.
  5.Observed the signals and got the flag.
-->70UgH_n07_70UgH
  1.Downloaded the code from the attachment and opened with arduino idle.
